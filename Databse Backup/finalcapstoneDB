Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Dip a slice of brioche in the batter, flipping to coat on both sides, then remove immediately to prevent the brioche from soaking up too much of the liquid. Add to the skillet and cook until both sides are golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining brioche, cooking in batches to avoid overcrowding and adding more butter as needed.

Add the mascarpone, granulated sugar, orange zest, lemon juice, vanilla, orange liqueur, and heavy cream and mix until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add the melted gelatin and mix until combined, about 1 minute. Add the mandarin orange slices and gently fold with a rubber spatula until evenly incorporated. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Make the ladyfinger soak: Line a 2-quart bowl with enough plastic wrap to hang over the edges by at least 4 inches (10 cm) all around. Spray the plastic wrap with nonstick spray.

In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the orange gelatin powder and boiling water. Whisk until the gelatin is mostly dissolved, 1-2 minutes. Add the orange juice and stir to combine.

Submerge 3 ladyfingers at a time in the orange juice mixture for 30-40 seconds, until the ladyfingers absorb the mixture, but not so long that the cookies begin to dissolve. Arrange the soaked ladyfingers on the bottom and up the sides of the prepared bowl, leaving 3 ladyfingers unsoaked for the final assembly. Scoop the orange mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in the bowl and smooth the top. Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the soaking liquid and place over the center of the cream.

Fold the ladyfingers around the edges of the bowl over the cream. (If the ladyfingers are too stiff to fold over easily, use kitchen shears to trim each ladyfingers flush with the orange mascarpone cream, then lay the trimmed pieces on the cream where they would fold over).

Cover the pudding with another sheet of plastic wrap. Place a small plate on top and weigh down with a can. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, up to overnight.

When ready to serve the pudding, remove the plate and the can and peel back the plastic. Place a serving platter over the bowl and quickly flip both the bowl and platter over to invert the pudding. Remove the bowl and plastic wrap.

Top the pudding with whipped cream and garnish with the mandarin oranges and mint leaves. Slice and serve.

INSERT INTO public.recipes VALUES (166, 'How To Make Classic Croissants At Home', 'Makes 10–12 croissants', 'There is really nothing better than a freshly baked croissant. The art of laminating dough takes practice and patience, but once you perfect it, the reward is insanely sweet. This recipe is truly a labor of love that makes perfectly flaky and pillowy pastries every time.', 'Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the milk and water. Add the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, malt and butter and use your hands to combine until the dough resembles a shaggy mass, then bring together into a rough ball (we do not want to develop gluten here, we just want to hydrate the flour and create a unified dough). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest at room temperature until it rises to 11/2 times its original size and has a slightly puffy texture, about 1 hour depending on the temperature of your kitchen.

Punch down the dough, then turn the dough from the bowl onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Gently press the dough into a rough 8-inch square. Wrap the dough tightly with the plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.

Make the butter block: Place a 12 x 15-inch (30 x 38 cm) sheet of parchment paper on a work surface with a long side nearest to you. Slice the butter lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick (6 mm) pieces, then arrange the slices in a single layer like tiles in the center of the parchment. Fold the edges of the parchment over to encase the butter, then flip the packet over so the seam is facing down. Let the butter packet rest at room temperature until it is pliable, but not greasy, about 30 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen.

Roll a rolling pin over the packet to distribute the butter in an even layer all the way to the edges and corners with no spaces between tiles. Place the butter packet in the refrigerator to chill until ready to use.

Laminate the dough: Remove the butter block from the refrigerator and let it soften at room temperature until bendy, but still cool, 10-20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen (the butter and dough should be about the same temperature and have the same texture when you hold them in your hands).

Lightly dust a clean surface with flour and place the refrigerated dough on top. Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour, then roll the dough out to a rectangle about 20 inches (50 cm) by 6 inches (15 cm), roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) wider and twice the length of the butter block. Orient the dough so a short side is nearest to you.

Open the butter packet and flip the parchment over to place the butter at the bottom of the dough rectangle, with about 1/2 inch (1.24 cm) of dough exposed around the sides and bottom of the butter block. Gently peel back the parchment paper from the butter and discard.

Fold the top half of dough over the butter, stretching gently so that the edge of the dough reaches the exposed edges beneath the butter. Use the palm of your hand to gently press the side and bottom edges of the dough together to seal the packet closed and lock in the butter. Turn the dough 90deg; it should look like a closed book with the left edge the "spine" side and the right edge the "page" side. Use the rolling pin to firmly (but not aggressively) press the dough, creating indents to help spread the butter between the layers. Use a serrated knife to cut down the middle of the spine to expose the butter and release the tension from folding the dough. Turn the dough 90deg again so the split spine is nearest to you. Gently begin to roll the dough away from you, stretching the dough vertically and moving the dough frequently to prevent sticking, until it is about 12 inches (30 cm) long, then continue until the dough is about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick; the dimensions of the dough should be about 24 inches (60 cm) x 12 inches (30 cm).

Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down, similar to folding a letter. Make sure that all of the corners of the dough meet to make a uniform block. (If the dough feels like it has become too elastic and bounces back when you try to roll it, or if the dough and butter feel like they are too warm and the butter might begin to melt and seep out from the block, cover the packet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has had time to relax and the butter has chilled slightly, 10-20 minutes.) Making sure the opening of the "letter" is nearest to you, roll the dough out again to about 1/4 inch thick, 24 inches (60 cm) long, and 12 inches (30 cm) wide. Use the serrated knife or pastry wheel as needed to trim about 1/2 inch (1.24 cm) from the edges of the dough to create an even rectangle.

Rotate the dough 90deg so a long edge is nearest to you. Fold the left two-thirds of dough over to just past the center of the dough. Then, fold the right third of the dough over towards the left so the edges meet. Gently press the two ends together to make a seam that resembles an offset book spine. Fold the left side of the dough over to meet the right edge of the dough (this is called a four-fold). Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate to let the gluten relax and butter chill, 30-40 minutes.

Shape the croissants: Line 2 18 x 13-inch (45 x 33 cm) baking sheets with parchment paper.

Place the rested dough on a very lightly floured surface with a long edge nearest to you. Roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, 24 inches (60 cm) long, and 12 inches wide (30 cm). Use the serrated knife or pastry wheel to trim about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the dough on all sides to make a clean and straight-edged rectangle.

Use a ruler to measure 3 inches (7 cm) to the right from the top left corner. Use a pastry wheel to cut from this point to the bottom left corner to create a triangle. Measure 3 inches (7 cm) to the right from the bottom left corner and cut straight up to create another triangle. Continue cutting the rest of the dough; you should have 10-12 dough triangles total.

Use the pastry wheel or a paring knife to cut a 1/2-inch (1.24 cm) slit at the center of the base of each triangle, then tightly roll the dough up from the base to the tip, without applying too much pressure. Place the croissants on a prepared baking sheet with the tips tucked underneath, spacing evenly on the pans, 5-6 per sheet.

Pour boiling water into 2 small ramekins or bowls. Place a ramekin on each sheet pan, then lightly cover the pans completely with plastic wrap (this will create a humid environment for the croissants to proof). Let the croissants proof until the dough is soft and puffed and slightly wobbles when you shake the pans, 2-3 hours.

Position the oven racks to the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350degF (180degC). Place a pan of boiling water at the bottom of the oven; this will help create steam as the croissants bake.

Brush the croissants with the beaten egg, then place in the oven. Bake, swapping the pans from the top to bottom rack and rotating 180deg halfway through, until the tops are a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Transfer the croissants to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 20 minutes.

Use a spoon to spread about 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing over the center of the dough rectangle, leaving a 2-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of mozzarella over the ranch dressing, followed by 1/4 cup of bacon, then 1/2 cup chicken. Sprinkle another tablespoon of mozzarella and chives on top, if desired.

Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot, add the lumpia to the hot oil and fry for 5-7 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to the wire rack to drain and repeat with the remaining lumpia, allowing the oil to return to temperature between batches.

Serve the lumpia with your favorite sauce for dipping.

Heat over low heat until the cream just barely begins to simmer, about 5 minutes. Transfer the infused cream and tea bag to a medium heatproof bowl, let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Make the boba with brown sugar syrup: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shake off any excess flour from the boba pearls, then add to the boiling water. Stir to separate the pearls, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until cooked through. Drain the boba and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Transfer to a medium heatproof bowl.

Meanwhile, make the brown sugar syrup: Add the muscovado sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the syrup thickens slightly, 5-7 minutes. Pour the syrup over the boba and stir to coat. Let sit for about 1 hour.

Working one spice group at a time, toast the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mace blades (if using), fenugreek seeds, black and green cardamom pods, black peppercorns, and cloves in the warm skillet until each spice is fragrant and lightly browned, a few minutes per spice. Transfer the toasted spices to a plate or small tray while you toast the remaining spices. Let cool to room temperature.

Set a mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Once all of the whole spices have cooled, transfer to a high-powered blender or spice grinder (working in batches, if needed) and grind the spices into a fine powder. Pour the ground spices into the strainer and sift into the bowl below. Return any larger pieces to the blender and re-grind and sift into the bowl.

Add the Kashmiri chile powder, ground ginger, garlic powder, and nutmeg to the bowl with the ground spices and mix well to combine (if using ground mace, add here). Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place until ready to use. The spice mixture will keep for up to 2 weeks.

Make the yogurt marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, 3/4 cup of the tandoori spice blend, the lemon juice, salt, ginger, and garlic until smooth.

Remove the innards from the turkey and discard (or save for another use). Pat the turkey dry all over with paper towels. Place the turkey in a bowl large enough to fit the bird, then pour the yogurt marinade all over the turkey. Use your fingers to gently loosen the turkey skin, starting from the top of the cavity and working your way toward the breasts and down toward the legs, being careful not to tear the skin. Use your hands to work the marinade underneath the skin and all over the entire bird. Once well-coated, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.

While the turkey is marinating, make the tandoori ghee: Add the ghee to a small saucepan and cook over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the tandoori spice blend (it should sizzle lightly once it touches the ghee), then stir to incorporate and remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the salt. Transfer 1/4 cup of the ghee to a small bowl and set aside to use for the gravy. Carefully pour the remaining 11/4 cups of ghee into a heat-proof container.

After marinating, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 2-3 hours before cooking.

Arrange a rack in the lower-middle section of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450degF (230degC). Set a V-shaped rack inside a roasting pan.

Once ready to cook, remove the turkey from the yogurt marinade and wipe off as much as possible. Squeeze out as much marinade as possible from underneath the turkey skin as well.

Grab the turkey by the legs and carefully transfer to the prepared roasting pan with the breast side up. With your hands, rub about a third of the tandoori ghee over the bird, then rub another third underneath the skin. Reserve the remaining ghee for basting the turkey.

Stuff the cavity with the lemons, garlic, ginger, and cilantro. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey, then tie the legs together with kitchen twine, wrapping around the bird to secure. Pour 3 cups of chicken stock into the bottom of the roasting pan.

Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, rotating halfway, until the skin is mostly golden brown. While the turkey roasts, melt the remaining third of tandoori ghee in a small saucepan over low heat, or in a small bowl in the microwave.

After roasting for 30 minutes, baste the turkey with the melted ghee. Reduce the oven temperature to 300degF (150degC). If the bottom of the pan looks dry, pour in 1-2 more cups of stock. Continue roasting, basting and rotating the turkey every 30 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the leg reaches 165degF (75degC), 120-150 minutes more. The skin should be shiny, crisp, and golden brown-if the skin begins to get too dark, lightly tend the bird with aluminum foil. Remove the turkey from the oven and baste once more. Let rest for 30-60 minutes. Reserve the drippings, discarding the fat, for making the gravy.

Make the tandoori gravy: Add the reserved 1/4 cup tandoori ghee to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking frequently, for 3-5 minutes, until the roux is darker in color and smells fragrant and toasted. Add 1 tablespoon of the tandoori spice blend and whisk to combine, letting toast for another minute, until fragrant. Gradually whisk in the turkey drippings (adding chicken stock as needed for a total of 3 cups). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until thickened slightly. Remove the gravy from heat.

Set a separate large heatproof bowl on top, making sure the water is not touching the bottom of the bowl, and add the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and pale, about 6 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot.

In a separate large bowl, whisk the mascarpone until fluffy, 2-3 minutes. Add the egg mixture to the mascarpone and use a rubber spatula to gently fold until incorporated.

Add the mascarpone mixture to the whipped cream and fold until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large piping bag and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a medium bowl, stir together the espresso and coffee liqueur. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Make the gulab jamun: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, cardamom, and water. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the rose water. Cover and set aside while you make the dough.

In a medium bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking soda, ghee, and yogurt until a ball of dough forms, using your hands to bring together. If the dough feels too dry, add a bit more yogurt. If the dough feels too sticky, add a little bit more flour.

Divide the dough evenly into 12 small balls, being careful not to press the dough or knead it (it is helpful to lightly oil your hands when working with the dough).

Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until the temperature reaches 350degF (180degC). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.

Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot, fry the dough balls in the hot oil until they are golden brown and float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain.

Serve the brisket with roasted vegetables and the reduced braising liquid for an extra mouthwatering moment.', 'Turn the broiler on high.

Set the brisket in a large roasting pan. Season generously on all sides with 11/2-2 tablespoons of salt and ground black pepper to taste.

Turn the brisket fat-side up and broil for 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fat cap, until there is no white fat remaining. Flip and broil for another 5-6 minutes on the second side, until browned.

Preheat the oven to 275@F (135degC).

In a large bowl, stir together the beef stock, tomato puree, red wine vinegar, honey, paprika, garlic powder, and cumin until well combined.

Make a bouquet garni: Fold a 6-inch square piece of cheesecloth in half and lay the thyme, bay leaves, and whole black peppercorns in the center. Fold the sides of the cheesecloth over the herbs and roll up to resemble a cigar. Tie with 3 2-inch pieces of twine to secure.

If the roasting pan fits on the stovetop, remove the brisket from the pan and set aside. Place the roasting pan on the stovetop and add the olive oil to the rendered beef fat in the pan. Heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. (Alternatively, remove the brisket from the roasting pan and pour any rendered beef fat into a large pot. Add the olive oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering.) Add the onions and carrots and season with the remaining teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 6-8 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.

Grease another large bowl with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the refrigerator. The dough should double in size.

Make the filling: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until no longer pink, 5-6 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside. Reserve 1/4 cup of the sausage for topping the focaccia.

Wipe out any excess grease from the skillet with a paper towel. Add the butter to the skillet. Once melted, add the onion, apples, and celery. Season with kosher salt and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, parsley, and thyme and cook until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cooked sausage. Let the filling cool to room temperature.

Assemble the focaccia: Grease an 8 x 13-inch baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, using your hands to spread the oil all around the pan to coat. Divide the dough in half and transfer one portion to the oiled pan. With oiled hands, gently stretch the dough to fill the baking sheet.

Spread the filling over the dough, then press the remaining dough over the filling, making sure to seal the edges so the filling is encased between the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof at room temperature for 1-2 hours, until the dough rises to fill the pan.

Preheat the oven to 400degF (200degC).

Remove the plastic wrap and drizzle the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface of the dough. Garnish with the reserved cooked sausage, apple slices, sage leaves, thyme, flaky salt, and black pepper.

Bake the focaccia for 40-45 minutes, turning halfway through, until the bread is golden brown and crispy.

Remove the focaccia from the oven and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before serving.

In a medium bowl, stir together the potato starch and the panko. Sprinkle over the squash and toss to coat evenly (if the squash pieces do not have an even light white coating, add more potato starch and toss again). Press the panko onto the squash to adhere.

Heat a few inches of canola oil in a wok over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350degF (180degC). Place a wire rack over a sheet tray.

Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, use tongs to carefully lower the squash pieces into the hot oil. Fry for 4-6 minutes, until dark golden brown. Transfer to the wire rack.

While the squash is still hot, toss in a large bowl with the sauce until well coated.

Garnished with sliced scallions and sesame seeds, then serve.

With its silky, smooth, and creamy chocolate filling and beautiful tender crust, it''''s easy to see why this dessert won over our hearts and stomachs.', 'Make the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, powdered sugar, and salt and pulse to incorporate. Add the butter, a few cubes at a time, and pulse until broken down to pea-sized pieces.

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, vanilla, and water. Slowly drizzle the egg yolk mixture into the food processor and pulse until the dough starts to come together but is not yet fully incorporated, 2-3 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and shape into a 1-inch-thick disc. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 2 days.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly for easy rolling.

Place the dough disc between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll out to an 11-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick, starting from the center and rolling away from you and rotating the dough 90deg every few rolls to ensure even thickness. If the edges of the dough crack, use the rolling pin to bring them back together. If the dough softens too much, refrigerate for a few minutes to re-solidify.

Carefully roll the dough onto the rolling pin, then unroll over a 9-inch tart pan and gently press against the bottom and sides. Roll the rolling pin over the pan to trim the edges of the crust flush with the pan. Patch any holes around the edges with the excess dough. Use a fork to prick holes all over the crust. Freeze for about 20 minutes, until the dough is firm.

Arrange an oven rack in the center position. Preheat the oven to 425degF (220degC).

Crumple a sheet of parchment paper in your hands, then unwrap and press flush against the crust, covering the edges to prevent them from burning. Fill the center of the crust with pie weights and spread in an even layer to cover the entire surface.

Bake the crust for 15 minutes, until partially baked and the parchment no longer sticks to the dough. Carefully remove the parchment and pie weights. Reduce the oven temperature to 350degF (180degC) and continue baking for another 15 minutes, until the bottom of the crust is starting to brown. Carefully transfer the tart pan to a wire rack and let cool for 30 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 300degF (150degC).

Make the filling: Chop the chocolate.

In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream and salt. Warm over medium-low heat until simmering gently around the edges of the pot, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, add the chopped chocolate, and stir to combine. Cover for 5 minutes, then uncover and whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Slowly pour a bit of the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, to temper, then pour in the remaining chocolate mixture and whisk to combine.

Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a spouted measuring cup, then pour into the cooled tart shell and spread evenly with an offset spatula.

Bake the tart for 25-30 minutes, until the filling is set and the surface is glossy.

Carefully remove the tart from the oven and transfer to the wire rack to cool for at least 45 minutes.

Make the mirror glaze: In a small bowl, soak the gelatin sheets in the ice water to bloom, about 5 minutes.

In a small pot, combine the sugar and room temperature water and bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the pot from the heat and sift in the cocoa powder. Stir to combine.

In another small pot, heat the cream over medium-low heat until starting to simmer. Slowly pour the hot cream into the cocoa mixture and gently whisk to combine. Be careful not to incorporate any air.

Once the gelatin has softened, lift the sheets from the cold water and wring out any excess water. Add the gelatin sheets to the cocoa and cream mixture and stir until fully dissolved.

Let the glaze cool until the temperature reaches between 90-110degF (32-43degC), or warm to the touch but no longer hot.

Strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve into a spouted measuring cup. Pour the glaze over the tart, using an offset spatula to cover evenly. Refrigerate the tart for about 1 hour to allow the mirror glaze to set.

Generously sprinkle flaky sea salt over the tart, then slice and serve with a dollop of whipped cream.

A creamy chicken gravy made with aromatics and vegetables is baked between two extra-crispy layers of homemade pie crust made with premium butter. We believe the key to amazing pot pie is to make everything from scratch. Yes, that means roasting your own chicken and making your own chicken stock and pie dough. Trust us, this is worth the work.', 'Roast the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425degF (220degC).

Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, including inside the cavity, then season the cavity with 1 tablespoon kosher salt.

In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt until well combined. Rub the butter mixture all over the outside of the chicken, including under the skin, making sure to rub the thighs and legs as well as the breast.

Add the lemon quarters, onion, and garlic to the cavity of the chicken.

To truss the chicken, use a piece of butcher''''''''s twine to tie the legs together so the bird holds a nice shape. Tuck the wingtips underneath the breasts so that they fit snugly. Transfer the chicken, breast-side up, to a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.

Roast the chicken for 60-80 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken thigh reaches 165degF (75degC). Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a large cutting board, reserving the juices in the roasting pan. Use a sharp knife to cut the legs and breasts away from the chicken carcass. Remove the skin from the chicken and transfer to the bowl of an Instant Pot, then pull the meat from the bones and shred into 1/2-inch pieces. Add the bones and carcass to the bowl with the skin. Transfer 4 cups of chicken to an airtight container for the pot pie filling and refrigerate until ready to use. Save any remaining chicken in a separate airtight container for another use; it will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Make the chicken stock: Add the onion, garlic, carrot, celery, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf to the Instant Pot bowl with the chicken skin, bones, and carcass. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken by 1 inch, then add the reserved chicken juices.

Put the lid on the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Once the timer goes off, turn the Instant Pot to quick release. Strain the chicken stock into a large bowl and discard the solids. Set aside 3 cups of stock at room temperature for the pot pie filling. Transfer the remaining chicken stock to an airtight container and save for another use; it will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.

Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and kosher salt. Add the butter and toss to coat each cube in the flour, then smash each piece of butter with your fingertips into lima bean-sized pieces. It''''''''s okay if some pieces are larger than others.

Add the ice, water, and vodka to a small bowl and stir to combine. Add 1-2 tablespoons at a time to the flour mixture and toss with a rubber spatula until the dough holds together when pressed between your hands. You may not need all of the liquid. The dough should not be very tacky or sticky.

Turn the dough onto a clean surface and use a bench scraper to gently bring it together into a rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds, like a business letter. Turn the dough 90deg, then flatten and fold into thirds again. Repeat until all of the bits of dough have been incorporated and it just comes together in a smooth, cohesive mass. Do not overwork. Divide the dough in half and wrap each portion tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 3 days.

Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, carrots, potatoes, and thyme and season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook until the onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes.

Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no lumps remain and the flour is evenly incorporated into the butter, 2-3 minutes.

Slowly whisk the reserved 3 cups of chicken stock, a little at a time. Simmer until the stock has reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the heavy cream and stir to combine.

Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the reserved 4 cups of shredded chicken, peas, and parsley. Season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Transfer the filling to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature, then place in the freezer for 15 minutes.

Assemble the pot pie: Place a portion of pie dough on a floured surface. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough and on the rolling pin, then roll the dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) round, about 1/3 inch thick, rotating 90deg every few rolls. Repeat with the remaining dough, rolling out slightly thinner to 1/4 inch thick. Roll the thicker dough round onto the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch (22 cm) glass deep dish pie plate, gently lifting and pressing so the dough is flush against the dish. Brush the inside of the dough with the egg wash, including the sides and outer rim. Add the chilled filling, spreading evenly.

Drape the remaining dough round over the pie. Trim any excess dough around the edges, then pinch the top and bottom doughs together to seal. Roll the edges under, all the way around the pie dish, and crimp using the knuckle of an index finger of one hand and the thumb and index finger of the other.

Brush the egg wash all over the top of the dough, getting in the grooves and sides of the pie. Use a paring knife to cut a few vents in the top to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top. Chill the assembled pie in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, until firm.

Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400degF (200degC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

Place the pie dish on the prepared baking sheet, then transfer to the oven and bake for 40-50 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.

Add the corn cobs to a 4-quart pot with the milk, half-and-half, garlic, and shallots. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook for 20 minutes to infuse. Remove the pot from the heat, strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, and discard the solids. Let cool for 10 minutes. Rinse out the pot.

Melt the 6 tablespoons of butter in the same pot over medium heat. Add the corn kernels and saute until beginning to caramelize, 3-4 minutes. Remove 1/2 cup of corn and set aside. Add the corn-infused milk mixture and a pinch of salt and cook for another minute, until starting to bubble and thicken slightly.

Transfer the corn mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean large bowl, using a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible from the corn pulp. Rinse out the pot.

In a medium bowl, combine the mozzarella, Gruyere, white cheddar, and Monterey Jack cheeses and mix well.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the flour to the pot. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the roux is light golden, 1-2 minutes. Add the corn cream and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened slightly, 3-5 minutes.. Gradually add 13/4 cups of the cheese mixture and whisk until smooth. Season with the white pepper and remove the pot from the heat.

Add the chicharrones to a food processor or blender. Process until broken down into coarse crumbs.

Add the cooked pasta shells to the prepared baking dish and pour the cheese sauce on top. Add the reserved corn kernels and half of the remaining cheese mix, then stir well to combine. Top with the remaining cheese mix and the chicharron crumbs.

Bake the mac ''''''''n'''''''' cheese for 25 minutes. Turn the oven to broil and cook for another 5 minutes, until the top of the mac ''''''''n'''''''' cheese is crispy. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.

Garnish the mac ''''''''n'''''''' cheese with the parsley, then serve.

Enjoy!', 'https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/347190.jpg', true, false);
